## About Project--
 1- In this project, you need to set up the Spring Tool Suite (STS). 
2-The project involves implementing a user authentication system where normal users can register themselves.
3-After registration, users should be able to log in and view their profiles, including compatibility information for weddings.

4-Additionally, an admin panel should be implemented, allowing administrators to view all users in a tabular form. 
5-The admin should also have the capability to generate a pie chart representing the distribution of users based on gender and geographical area.

6-To achieve this, you can utilize the Spring framework for user authentication, Spring Boot for simplifying the setup, and a database to store user information.
7-Thymeleaf can be used for building dynamic HTML templates to display user profiles and admin-related information.

8-Consider incorporating Spring Security for user authentication and authorization. 
9-You may also use a charting library, such as Chart.js, to create the pie chart based on the data retrieved from the database.

10-Make sure to structure your project appropriately, with separate packages for controllers, services, repositories, and views.
11-Implement the necessary database entities to store user information and compatibility details.
